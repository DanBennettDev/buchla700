=============================== Score Input Language ===========================

Score input commands consist of a sequence of control commands and notes,
or rests,  in the form of ASCII strings.

Control Commands:
-----------------

!score = n		make 'n' the current score and display it
!clear n		clear score 'n'
!clear *		clear all scores
!clear $		clear the current score

!goto n @ m		display score at beat 'n', frame 'm'

!pos = n @ m		position p_cur at beat 'n', relative frame 'm'
!beat = n		position p_cur at beat 'n', relative frame 0
!frame = n		position p_cur at absolute frame 'n'
!find l n		position p_cur at the left of the chain at time 'n' 
!find r n		position p_cur at the right of the chain at time 'n' 

!weight = n		set the note weight at 'n' percent

,			advance p_cur by current note value
.			advance p_cur by 1 frame
;			advance p_cur to next beat
:			advance p_cur by one beat interval  (192 frames)

!group = n		make 'n' the current group
!status = on		enable the current group
!status = off		disable the current group
!inst = n		select intstrument 'n' for the current group
!trans = {+|-} n	transpose the current group + or - 'n' cents
!dyn = n		set the current group dynamics value to 'n'
!loc = n		set the current group location value to 'n'

!tempo = n		set the tempo to 'n' beats per minute  (4..240)
!tuning = n		select 'n' as the current tuning table
!stop			stop the score clock

!wait			wait for a CR
!verbose		enter verbose mode
!quiet			leave verbose mode
!test			enter testing mode
!normal			leave testing mode

!chase			display the score chain from p_cur to the end
!show active		display the active score list
!show names		display the score names
!show sections		display the sections
!snap			display the score pointers and times

!end			end of commands

Notes and Rests:
----------------

Notes are specified as follows:

	val [#] oct [+|-|/n]

	where:

		val	note pitch	a through g
		oct	note octave	0 through 9
		#	accidental flag
		+	note begin at current time
		-	note end at current time
		/n	note of length 1/n starting at current time


e.g.:	a#0+		start a note of pitch a0

	a#0-		end a note of pitch a0

	c3/4		enter a 1/4 note of pitch c3

	e7		enter a note of pitch e7 with the same value
			as the previous note


Rests are specified as follows:

	r n / m

	where:

		n	number of consecutive rests
		m	rest interval  (1/m note)


e.g.:  r2/1		2 whole note resets


Note on/off times are calculated as follows:

	noteval = 192L / QQnum;

	noteon  = t_cur;

	noteoff = t_cur + ((noteper * noteval) / 100L);

where:

	QQNum   = note value	default = 1/4 note  (192/4)	

	noteper = note weight	default = 80 percent
