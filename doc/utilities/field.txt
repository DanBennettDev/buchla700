NAME
	field - select fields or columns from a file

SYNOPSIS

	field [-tc] [-nc] [-pc] n ...

DESCRIPTION

	The field command copies selected, delimiter-separated fields from 
	the standard input to the standard output.

	Fields are numbered from 1 and a field may be requested more than once.

	The default delimiter is a tab.

	This can be changed to character c with the option -tc .
	If the form -nc is used, the delimiter c is used on input,
	but the output is still separated by tabs.  If the form -pc
	is use, the delimiter c is used on output, but the input is
	still delimited by tabs.

EXAMPLE

	The following command extracts the login names, user and group numbers
	from the password file:


	field -t: 1 3 4 </etc/passwd

SEE ALSO

	Cut, which is available on System V.
	There is a version of cut on this system, but no manual entry yet.

BUGS/LIMITATIONS

	The number of input or output fields may not exceed 256 and
	the maximum line length is 4096 characters.
