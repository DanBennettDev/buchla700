NAME
	body - display lines from the body of a file

SYNOPSIS
	body [-s num] [-{e|n} num] [-{l|w|c}] [-d num] [file] ...

DESCRIPTION
	Body reads each file in sequence and displays it on the
	standard output.  Thus

		body file

	displays the file on the standard output, and

		body file1 file2 >file3

	concatenates the first two files and places the result on
	the third.

	If no input file is given body reads from the standard input
	file.

	The -s option specifies the unit to start output at. If no
	starting unit is specified, 1 is used.

	The -e option specifies the unit to end output at. The
	default is to output until end of file.

	The -n option specifies the number of units to output. The
	default is 10.

	The -{lwc} option specifies the unit to use for -e, -s, and
	-f. The units are line, word, or character.

	Only one of -e or -n, or one of -l, -w, or -c allowed.

	The -d option specifies debug flags.  Normally this option
	will not be used.

EXAMPLES
	To copy lines 5 through 10 of the file myfile to the file
	junk, use:

		body -s 5 -e 10 myfile > junk
	or
		body -s 5 -n 5 myfile > junk

NOTES
	There is an arbitray limit of 1024 characters per line.
