This is a substitute version of CALENDAR(1).  It is upward compatible
with the standard UNIX version, but has several extensions, and is
much faster, as it does not envoke EGREP(1).  The executable generated
by compiling calendar.c (see the makefile) is envoked for each user.
It should be installed in /usr/lib/calendar, or the shell script
will need to be changed.  If you have STRCHR(3) instead of V7's INDEX(3),
or you have some other function for finding a character in a string,
change/remove the #define in calendar.c.  strchr() is used in the
C code.  If you run calendar SETUSERID to ROOT, then change the man page
to reflect that fact that world read access is not needed.

You should be able to just type "make install" and get a proper install.
