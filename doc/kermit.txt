     kermit r [ddzinlbpto line baud par string]         to receive files
     kermit g [ddzinlbpto line baud par string] file ...to get files
     kermit v [ddzinlbpto line baud par string]         to enter server mode

DESCRIPTION

	This is the Atari version of the public domain Kermit telecommunication
	protocol.

Commands:

	c=connect
	g=get
	f=finish
	r=receive
	s=send
	v=server
	x=exit

Modifiers:

	b=baud rate
	d=debug
	e=escape char
	h=half duplex
	i=image mode,
	l=tty line
	n=no filename conversion
	o=prepend string to output files,
	p=parity
	t=suppress timeouts
	z=log packet transactions.

When sending, kermit will expand wildcards and handle drives.  The line

	kermit s 0d:*.c

sends all files with an extension of c in user 0 of disk d.  Since this is
a feature of the runtime, when using the get command, filenames containing
wildcards must be in double quotes.

Both the remote and local kermit must know an image file is being
transferred in order for the file to be useable.

Baud rate is not implemented.
