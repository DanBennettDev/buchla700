IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

This version of the Multi-Tasker has a debug buffer optionally located at
$40000 in RAM.  To use it, the symbol "DEBUGGER" must be defined, and the
include file "debug.h" must be included in files which are to be debugged.

The linkrt.bat file is used to link the system for test ROMs.

The linkrom.bat file is used to link the system for production ROMs.

For production versions, be certain not to define "DEBUGGER" anywhere,
or the debug code will corrupt whatever is living at $40000 and above.

Before testing the code, remember to clear the debug buffer with ROMP
or mysterious crashes are likely to occur.

Use grep to find the address of DB_Dump to be able to get a readable dump
of the debug data.
